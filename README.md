## About Me
I am an IT worker with a passion for cybersecurity and learning technologies. I have 1 year of experience in the IT job sector with a strong education in computer science, right now I am studying to gain a certification in cybersecurity through a course I have undertaken by Google called Foundations of Cybersecurity. My objective is to enter the field of cybersecurity and climb my way up the career ladder, maybe one day starting my own cybersecurity business.
