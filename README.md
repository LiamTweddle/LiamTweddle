## About Me
I am an IT worker with a passion for cybersecurity and learning technologies. I have 1 year of experience in the IT job sector with a strong education in computer science, right now I am studying to gain a certification in cybersecurity through a course I have undertaken by UDEMY called CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701) Bootcamp. My objective is to enter the field of cybersecurity and climb my way up the career ladder, maybe one day starting my own cybersecurity business.
